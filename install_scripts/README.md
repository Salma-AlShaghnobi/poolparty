# Installation

Installing the [poolparty package](https://github.com/StevenMicheletti/poolparty/) to run PPAlign and PPanalyze on the example it provides requires installing certain versions of Ubuntu, R, and the libraries listed below (which may be older versions). The following sections are not exhaustive (it does not include a line to install perl, for example), but they correspond to the parts of the installation that need more work than just running an install command. 

## Ubuntu Versions
There are R packages (for example, [multtest](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/multtest.html)) that require R version 4.4.* which according to the [R website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/fullREADME.html) (as of August 2024) only supports the following Ubuntu versions:

 - Noble Numbat (24.04, amd64 only)
 - Jammy Jellyfish (22.04, amd64 only)
 - Focal Fossa (20.04; LTS and amd64 only)
 - Bionic Beaver (18.04; LTS)
 - Xenial Xerus (16.04; LTS)
     
If the Linux version is not listed (e.g., 23.04), and installation of R 4.4.* is unattainable, you may need to upgrade or downgrade to one of the previously specified versions.

## R and R Packages

If the essential R packages are not available, PoolParty will try to install them automatically; however, some will fail if the R version is not 4.4.*. Below are the listed required high-level packages for each of the main poolparty scripts, and the bolded packages are the ones known to require R 4.4.*:

* PPalign: matrixStats, tidyr, stringr, data.table

* PPstats: reshape, fBasics, ggplot2, RColorBrewer

* PPanalyze: matrixStats, plyr, stringr, data.table, fBasics, ape, metap

If R is already installed, you can check the version by running the following:
```
R --version
```

### R 4.4.*
If R is not installed or is not the correct version, first ensure that the Ubuntu version you are using is supported by running: 
```
lsb_release -a
```
Which should generate the following output, identifying the version and codename:

    No LSB modules are available.
    Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
    Description:	Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS
    Release:	22.04
    Codename:	jammy

Assuming it's a supported distribution and the codename you're using is "Jammy" as seen in the result of the preceding command, run the following to install the most recent version of R.
```	
 sudo wget -qO- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cran.gpg
```
a. Necessary if the public key needed to verify the packages from the repository are missing.
```
sudo echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cran.gpg] https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu jammy-cran40/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cran.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base
```
### R Packages
Certain R packages require lower-level libraries that may not have previously been installed. To install them, use the following commands:
```
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-gnutls-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev libfftw3-dev
```

To update all installed packages to their most recent versions, or rebuild them if you updated R, use the following command:
```
Rscript -e 'update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)'
```

PPanalyze seems to require some additional packages:
```
Rscript -e 'if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager"); BiocManager::install("multtest")'
```

PPstats seems to require some additional packages:
```
Rscript -e 'install.packages("sparseMatrixStats", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")'
```

In addition to these, these additional packages needed to be installed to install Picard Tools correctly:

* Java 8u66 - [Link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u66-relnotes.html), [Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PVnmFa7VrGE1wAH39gO5QNdZHbyEuAeI/view?usp=drive_link)

### Samtools (1.5)

Download and extract the directory, then run the configure command to specify the installation path, and finally run make and make install. To eliminate ambiguity, add an extra soft link to ```/usr/bin```. If you don't have sudo privileges, install locally and add the local binary to the path. 
Steps:
```
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
 make
 sudo make install
 sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/samtools /usr/bin/samtools
```
Verify the version is correct by running: 
```
 samtools
```
### Samblaster (0.1.24)
Download and extract the directory, run make, and then create a soft link to the resulting binary
```
 make
 sudo ln -s ~/.local/packages/samblaster-v.0.1.24/samblaster /usr/bin/samblaster
```
Verify the version is correct by running: 
```
samblaster
```
### Bcftools (1.5)
Download and extract the directory, configure to set the installation path, and then run make and make install. To eliminate ambiguity, add an extra soft link to ```/usr/bin```. If you don't have sudo rights, install locally and add the local binary to the path. 
```
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
 make
 sudo make install
 sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/bcftools /usr/bin/bcftools
```
Verify the version is correct by running:
```
 bcftools
```
### Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA; 07.12)

BWA requires only that you run 'make' and make the resulting binary file available. The simplest way to accomplish this is to make a soft link to it in ```/usr/bin```.
```
make
sudo ln -s ~/.local/packages/bwa-0.7.12/bwa /usr/bin/bwa
```
Verify the version is correct by running: 
``` 
bwa
```

### Popoolation2 (1.201)

Use svn to get the package and then move it to the desired directory. If it isn't already installed, you'll need to install it before running the commands below. 
```
 svn checkout http://popoolation2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ popoolation2
 sudo mv popoolation2 /usr/local/bin/popoolation2_1201
```
### BBMap (37.93)
Download the specific version then move it to the ```local/bin``` directory
```
sudo mv bbmap /usr/local/bin
```
Verify the version is correct by checking the readme file in the bbmap directory

### Java 8u66
Installing the correct version of Java was the most laborious part of the process. Download the specific version from the directory
```
 sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/java
 sudo mv jdk1.8.0_66 /usr/local/java/
 sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_66/bin/java 1
 sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_66/bin/javac 1
 sudo update-alternatives --config java
```
a. This command will list all installed versions of Java, select the one with the proper jdk (jdk1.8.0)
```
 sudo update-alternatives --config javac
```
a. Similar to above

Verify the version is correct by running:
```
 java -version
 javac -version
```
### Gradle

Note: This requires a few things to be installed in addition to the correct Java version above including curl, sdk (or brew),
```
 sudo apt install curl
 curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
 sdk install gradle 8.9
```
### Picard Tools (2.17.11)

Very specific with what it needs to build properly:
* Gradle requires the environment variable JAVA_HOME be set to the correct java version we installed earlier (add this to your .bashrc so it doesnâ€™t have to be run again):
```
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_66/ 
  export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```
* The picard tools directory needs to have git initialized. This is not an issue if you used ```git clone``` to download the repo, however downloaded directly, the following command needs to be run:
  ```git init```
  
In the directory where picard is installed, run the following commands to create the picard jar file:
```
 ./gradlew shadowJar
 java -jar build/libs/picard.jar
```
The jar file is what is used by poolparty, so you can either link to this file directly in your config, or create softlink to a common location and link there:
```
 ln -s ~/.local/packages/picard-2.17.11/build/libs/picard.jar /usr/local/bin/picard.jar
```
### Fastqc (0.11.7)

Download and move it somewhere permanent, then run the following commands from within it:
```
chmod +x ./fastqc
sudo ln -s ~/.local/packages/FastQC/fastqc /usr/bin/fastqc
```
